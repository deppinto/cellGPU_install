//! A class that allows efficient on-the-fly computation of auto-correlation functions
/*!
This class provides a multiple-time autocorrelation scheme. It is a generalization of the algorithm
presented in Frenkel and Smit (with independently controllable lag times), as explained in:
"Efficient on the fly calculation of time correlation functions in computer simulations"
J. Ramirez, S. K. Sukumaran, B. Vorselaars, and A. E. Likhtman
The Journal of Chemical Physics 133, 154103 (2010).

A primary modification of the source code linked to from that paper is that this class does not need
to set a maximum number of correlator levels; the correlator structure simply grows whenever it needs to
