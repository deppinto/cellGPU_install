         The Hilbert sorting stuff makes keeping track of particles, and re-indexing things when
         particle number changes, a pain. Here's a description of the four relevant data structures.
         tagToIdx[i] = a. At the beginning of a simulation, a particle had index "i", meaning its
                        current state was found in position "i" of all various data vectors and arrays.
                        That same particle's data is now in position "a" of those data structures.
                        Short version: "Where do I look to find info for what I orinally called partice i?"
        idxToTag[a] = i. That is, idxToTag just helps invert the tagToIdx list.
                    idxToTag[tagToIdx[i]]=i
        The above two structures (and the vertex versions of them) tell you how to go back and forth
        between the current state of the system and the initial state of the system. What about going
        back and forth between the current sorted state and the previous sorted state? The "itt" and
        "tti" vectors give this information.
        The itt and tti vectors are completely overwritten each time a spatial sorting is called.
        By the way, I apologize if the nomenclature of "index" vs. "tag" is the opposite of what you,
        the reader of these code comments, might expect.
