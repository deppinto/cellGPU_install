/*!
 * voronoiModelBase is a core engine class, capable of taking a set of points
 * in a periodic domain, performing Delaunay triangulations on them, testing whether
 * those triangulations are valid on either the CPU or GPU, and locally repair
 * invalid triangulations on the CPU.

 * Voronoi models have their topology taken care of by the underlying triangulation, and so child 
   classes just need to implement an energy functions (and corresponding force law)
