//! A simple text-based output for voronoi models...only supports sequential writing of frames

/*!
The text database format is as follows. For each frame, a line is written with N (either vertices or cells), the time, and the four box dimensions.
There is then a line for each cell/vertex, with position and cell type (or position and vertex connections).
All of the above data is just tab delimited. Writing to the middle of a file is not supported
